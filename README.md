# Robust-Dependence-Modeling-and-Copula-Simulation
Multivariate t-distribution fitting, robust covariance estimation, and copula-based dependence modeling in R. Includes profile likelihood estimation of Î½ across sectors and decades, simulation of Gaussian and t-copulas, and empirical tail-dependence analysis using real-world financial data (e.g., IBM &amp; CAT).
